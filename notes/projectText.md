# Actsport
This project was a consulting job for the startup Actsport. The start up is
developing a application for sport psychology. The application had some design
flaws in a interaction point of view. I helped the company to come up with
a strategy how to improve the app. I then created a prototype using figma. I did
tests on potential customers and on some people from the local gym. The result
can be seen below.
